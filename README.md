# Decentralized Accountability Network

## Transition

After months of [appraised](https://alchemy.daostack.io/dao/0x294f999356ed03347c7a23bcbcf8d33fa41dc830/proposal/0x9421968a79dfc6b9437c04810293ff7f732fed2190ba59652b0dd6ffeda45e39) but also controversial work, the Accountability Task Force experiment has come to an end. At the same time, many new people have shown interest to participate on the nurture of accountability practices. In so, we both stepped out and started stewarding the reformulation of the accountability roles in our DAO organizational model:

* from a Task force as a small team, laser focused on clear goals
* to a Working Group, with a broader, open and flexible topology
